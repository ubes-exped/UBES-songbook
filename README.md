# UBES Songbook

UBES has a long tradition of singing folk songs, but in recent years it has been noted that this can be quite exclusive because many new members do not know the words to the songs.
In order to be more inclusive to these new members, we have compiled a list of society favourites, which can be printed out and distributed at relevant society events.

## Authors

- Alice Denning (song compilation)
- Raef Coles, Charlie Harding (preparation and typesetting)

## Playlists

- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2a8qmHglthbuB5US3cEcuU)
- [YouTube](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4mBwNJeO-zGOchjv0GJUi5-3BZGbi7F)
